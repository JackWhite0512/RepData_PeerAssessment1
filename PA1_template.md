## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike
Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the
‚Äúquantified self‚Äù movement ‚Äì a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find
patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these
data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain
and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing
and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and
include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:

-   Dataset: [Activity monitoring
    data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip)

The variables included in this dataset are:

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are
coded as ùôΩùô∞) </br> date: The date on which the measurement was taken in
YYYY-MM-DD format </br> interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval
in which measurement was taken </br> The dataset is stored in a
comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568
observations in this dataset.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

read the downloaded csv file (alternatively, copy URL, download and
unzip).

    df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
    df$date = as.Date(df$date)

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1.  total number of steps taken per day

<!-- -->

    steps_tot <- aggregate(df$steps,by=list(df$date),FUN=sum,na.rm=TRUE) 
    colnames(steps_tot) <- c("Day", "Steps")

1.  histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

<!-- -->

    hist(steps_tot$Steps,
         breaks = 25,
         col="cyan", 
         xlab="Steps (total)", 
         ylim=c(0, 10), 
         main="Daily Steps Histogram")

1.  mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

<!-- -->

    mean(steps_tot$Steps)

    ## [1] 9354.23

    median(steps_tot$Steps)

    ## [1] 10395

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1.  time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average
    number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

<!-- -->

    pattern_avrg <- aggregate(df$steps, 
                              by = list(Interval = df$interval), na.rm=T, 
                              FUN = "mean")
    colnames(pattern_avrg) <- c("Interval", "Avrg_Steps")
    plot(pattern_avrg$Interval, pattern_avrg$Avrg_Steps, type = "l", col="purple",
         ylab = "Average steps", 
         xlab = "Intervals (5-min)",
         main = "Average daily activity pattern")

![](PA1_template_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

1.  5-minute interval containing the maximum number of steps

<!-- -->

    Steps_max <- pattern_avrg$Interval[which(pattern_avrg$Avrg_Steps==max(pattern_avrg$Avrg_Steps))]

    Steps_max

    ## [1] 835

## Imputing missing values

1.  Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the
    dataset

<!-- -->

    sum(is.na(df$steps))

    ## [1] 2304

1.  filling in all of the missing values in the dataset

<!-- -->

    df$steps[is.na(df$steps)]<-mean(df$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
    head(df)

    ##     steps       date interval
    ## 1 37.3826 2012-10-01        0
    ## 2 37.3826 2012-10-01        5

    ## 6 37.3826 2012-10-01       25

    stopifnot(sum(is.na(df)) == 0)

1.  Create a new dataset with the missing data filled in

<!-- -->

    df.new = df
    df$steps[is.na(df$steps)]<-mean(df$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
    stopifnot(sum(is.na(df.new)) == 0)

    colnames(steps_tot_new) <- c("Day", "Steps")

    hist(steps_tot_new$Steps,
         breaks = 25,

         xlab="Steps (total)", 
         ylim=c(0, 20), 
         main="Daily Steps Histogram (filled NA)")

    mean(steps_tot_new$Steps)                       ## The mean has changed and is

    ## [1] 10766.19

    median(steps_tot_new$Steps)                     ## now equal to the median.
